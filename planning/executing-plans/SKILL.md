# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## When to Use

**After:**
- A plan exists (from writing-plans skill)
- Plan has been reviewed and approved

**Before:**
- Starting implementation
- Touching any code

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read plan file completely
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns
3. If concerns: Raise them before starting
4. If no concerns: Create task list and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch

**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report

When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue

Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Run full test suite
- Verify all requirements met
- Prepare for merge/PR

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Plan is updated based on feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself:
- Skipping plan steps
- Not running verifications
- Adding features not in plan
- Guessing instead of asking
- Continuing after failures

**STOP. Return to Step 3 (Report).**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I know a better way" | Follow the plan, raise concerns later |
| "Verification is slow" | Verification catches bugs |
| "Small deviation is fine" | Deviations compound |
| "I'll verify later" | Verify now or bugs escape |

## Remember

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
